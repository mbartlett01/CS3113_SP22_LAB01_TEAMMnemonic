## Tentative Plan 
### Problems and Solutions
-   Main Problem: Creation of a Linked List Using Bubble Sort in Assembly 
-  Sub Problem: Creation of Node
   - Created a quad list/variable holding various numbers
-  Sub Problem: Pointing to Next Node
   -  Using a back-to-back method to address this issue
   -   Changed to parallel list format to address the issue instead, which is done using a quad list/variable as well as buffer 
- Sub Problem: Implement Bubble Sort on List
   - Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Functions for Compartmentalization
   - Changed code so that register would be passed as parameters allowing for the creation of functions 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Doubly Linked List
   - Created a third quad list/variable 
   - Dropped -> kept breaking other sections of our code (specifically the during sorting and address filling) 
- Sub Problem: Allow for Fixed Sized List to be Read In 
   - Dropped -> minimal returns on despite the significant time investment
- Sub Problem: Implement Insertions Sort on List
   -  Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting (similar methods to the bubble sort function)
 - Sub Problem: Print Output  
 - Used buffer to create a section that could be outputted to the terminal
 - Sub Problem: GDB Scripting
   - Set up correct files in order to script
## Statment of Work 
To advance the teamwork and communication of the Mnemonic's team, we have created this
teamwork agreement to define how we will work together.
Each member of the team is responsible and accountable to uphold our teamwork agreement as we
work together to improve our teamwork and communication as well as the outcome of our
patients/clients.
The teamwork agreement we commit to:
- Be respectful of our team members
- Direct communication, rather than sidebar conversations
- A commitment to complete tasks for which we are responsible
- Kindness and compassion towards each other
- Holding each other accountable when someone is not acting in accordance with this agreement
Where differences arise, our team is committed to resolving conflict by:
- Addressing differences in a timely, open, and honest manner,
- Speaking to the people directly involved in the conflict first before approaching a third-party
mediator, such as a manager or director, and
- Avoiding using blaming language. Use "I" language instead of "you" when talking about the
issue.
#### Each team member will contribute as much as possible to each section of the project. Meetings will be going over the work each individual did, merging all of the work done as well as setting goals for the next meeting.

## Meeting Notes
-  February 18th: Set initial timeline and meeting dates. We planned on working individually and then reporting back on the following Monday 
-  February 19th: Set up an outline for the report and started filling out the assumptions section. We pooled together knowledge of the work done on the weekend.
-  February 24th: Finished basic bubble sort program. Set up next meeting for addition specification for additional points. We moved the dates back for the presentation and report.
-  February 25th: Finished the implementation of the function compartmentalization specification.  
-  February 26th: Ran into some troubles with the bubble sort program and the implementation of insertion sort when introducing. We found a massive flaw in the design that previously went unnoticed. We started attempting to read and write input files. 
-  February 27th: Hit a brick wall and struggle to figure out how to fix many of the errors and issues created by the flaw in our previous design. We continued having problems getting a file read in to act as input. 
 - March 3rd: We got together twice to work on the presentation and recorded said presentation. 
 ## Self-Assessment 
 
 ### Averi's Assessment
 Overall, I feel that all members contributed to the project in a reasonably fair manner; however, I think that Michael did the most work when it came to the coding portion of the lab. I worked heavily on both the report as well as the README file. I also contributed by finding out ways that would not work in the coding section of the lab, especially towards the beginning. I did help both Tina in Michael on the area they contributed heavily to by offering ideas, solutions, as well as support. Overall do the amount of heavy lifting Michael did on the more challenging sections of the lab, I will have to give him more points (40% to Michael, 30% for me and Tina each). 
 ### Michael's Assessment: 
 Overall, I feel as if all members contributed their fair share to the project. I contributed to the team by writing the code implementing the linked list as dual arrays, as well as working on both sorting algorithms and printing the values of the array to the terminal. I also worked some on the README and helped to edit the report and the presentation. Tina contributed to the project by helping with scripting GDB commands, working on file input and output, and by working on the presentation and report. Averi contributed to the project by writing a large portion of the report, working on the presentation, helping with planning the sorting algorithms, and writing most of the README file. Since we all worked on many different areas and everyone did their agreed-upon work, I would personally distribute the points equally between group members (33.3% each).
 
 ### Tina's Assessment
 Overall, I feel like all of the members contributed to the project very well, though I believe Michael did a substantial amount when it comes to the work. I contributed by scripting GBD commands, attempting file input and output, writing the presentation, and helping with the report. Averi worked heavily on the report and the README and contributed greatly to the coding process by coming up with ideas and keeping the team on schedule and in check. Michael was the tanker and did a bulk of the coding while still finding time to help with my presentation and Averi's report. He also wrote a huge chunk of the README. I believe with the amount of effort everyone put in, Michael deserves 40%, and Averi and I split the remaining for 30% each.
 
 ### Average Assesment 
 - Averi: 31%
 - Tina: 31%
 - Michael: 38%

 ## Reflections
 Individually, we could have done several things differently in this lab. One valuable lesson we learned in this lab is to not be afraid to give up or ask for help in a lab. If one person is working on something for a long time, they should ask for help from the group members, and if they still cannot resolve the problem and it is not essential, then the group can move on to other goals. We did this for several tasks, however, many tasks likely took up more of an individual's time than necessary if they had asked for help or given up sooner. As a team, I think one thing we would change if we were to do the lab again would be to document and write the report more as we go, as well as to possibly try a wider range of extensions to the project so that we have more options to figure which ones work and which ones don't work early on. We also think that as an instructor, in the future, you should make the grading more transparent and less competitive. Additionally, we think that peer reviews should be anonymous to prevent conflict or disagreement.
