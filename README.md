## Tentative Plan 
### Problems and Solutions
-   Main Problem: Creation of a Linked List Using Bubble Sort in Assembly 
-  Sub Problem: Creation of Node
   - Created a quad list/variable holding various numbers
-  Sub Problem: Pointing to Next Node
   -  Using a back-to-back method to address this issue
   -   Changed to parallel list format to address the issue instead, which is done using a quad list/variable as well as buffer 
- Sub Problem: Implement Bubble Sort on List
   - Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Functions for Compartmentalization
   - Changed code so that register would be passed as parameters allowing for the creation of functions 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Doubly Linked List
   - Created a third quad list/variable 
   - Dropped 
- Sub Problem: Allow for Fixed Sized List to be Read In 
   - Dropped 
- Sub Problem: Implement Insertions Sort on List
   -  Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting (similar methods to the bubble sort function)
 - Sub Problem: Print Output  
 - Used buffer to create a section the could be outputed sto the terminal

### Work Plan

## Statment of Work 
To advance the teamwork and communication of the Mnemonic's team, we have created this
teamwork agreement to define how we will work together.
Each member of the team is responsible and accountable to uphold our teamwork agreement as we
work together to improve our teamwork and communication as well as the outcome of our
patients/clients.
The teamwork agreement we commit to:
- Be respectful of our team members
- Direct communication, rather than side bar conversations
- A commitment to complete tasks for which we are responsible
- Kindness and compassion towards each other
- Holding each other accountable when someone is not acting in accordance with this agreement
Where differences arise, our team is committed to resolving conflict by:
- Addressing differences in a timely, open and honest manner,
- Speaking to the people directly involved in the conflict first, before approaching a third party
mediator, such as a manager or director, and
- Avoiding using blaming language. Use “I” language instead of “you” when talking about the
issue.
Each team member will contribute as much as possible to each section of the project. Meetings will be going over the work each indvidual did merging all of the work done as well as setting goals for the next meeting.

- Time is defined in portional units ranging from 1-10, not hours
## Meeting Notes
-  February 18th: Set initial timeline and meeting dates. We planned on working individually and then reporting back on the following Monday 
-  February 19th: Set up an outline for the report and started filling out the assumptions section. We pooled together knowledge of the work done on the weekend.
-  February 24th: Finished basic bubble sort program. Set up next meeting for addition specification for additional points. We moved the dates back for the presentation and report.
-  February 25th: Finished the implementation of the function compartmentalization specification.  
-  February 26th: Ran into some troubles with the bubble sort program and the implementation of insertion sort when introducing. We found a massive flaw in the design that previously went unnoticed. We started attempting to read and write input files. 
-  February 27th: Hit a brick wall and struggle to figure out how to do fix many of of th errors and issues created by the flaw in our previous desgin. Continued having issues getting a file read in to act as input. 
 
 ## Self-Assessment 
 
 ### Averi's Assessment
 
 ### Michael's Assessment: 
 Overall, I feel as if all members contributed their fair share to the project. I contributed to the team by writing the code implementing the linked list as dual arrays as well as working on both sorting algorithms and printing the values of the array to the terminal. I also worked some on the README and helped to edit the report and the presentation. Tina contributed to the project by helping with scripting GDB commands, working on file input and output, and by working on the presentation and report. Averi contributed to the project by writing a large portion of the report, working on the presentation, helping with planning the sorting algorithms, and writing most of the README file. Since we all worked on many different areas and everyone did their agreed upon work, I would personlly distribute the points equally between group members (33.3% each).
