## Tentative Plan 
### Problems and Solutions
-   Main Problem: Creation of a Linked List Using Bubble Sort in Assembly 
-  Sub Problem: Creation of Node
   - Created a quad list/variable holding various numbers
-  Sub Problem: Pointing to Next Node
   -  Using a back-to-back method to address this issue
   -   Changed to parallel list format to address the issue instead, which is done using a quad list/variable as well as buffer 
- Sub Problem: Implement Bubble Sort on List
   - Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Functions for Compartmentalization
   - Changed code so that register would be passed as parameters allowing for the creation of functions 
- Sub Problem: Creation of Doubly Linked List
   - Created a third quad list/variable 
   - Dropped 
- Sub Problem: Allow for Fixed Sized List to be Read In 
   - Dropped 
- Sub Problem: Implement Insertions Sort on List
   -  Used various registers as well as the stack to hold list items allowing for sorting (similar methods to the bubble sort function)
 - Sub Problem: Print Output

## Meeting Notes
-  February 18th: Set initial timeline and meeting dates. We planned on working individually and then reporting back on the following Monday 
-  February 19th: Set up an outline for the report and started filling out the assumptions section. We pooled together knowledge of the work done on the weekend.
-  February 24th: Finished basic bubble sort program. Set up next meeting for addition specification for additional points. We moved the dates back for the presentation and report.
-  February 25th: Finished the implementation of the function compartmentalization specification.  
-  February 26th: Ran into some troubles with the bubble sort program and the implementation of insertion sort when introducing. We found a massive flaw in the design that previously went unnoticed. We started attempting to read and write input files. 
-  February 27th: Hit a brick wall and struggle to figure out how to do fix many of of th errors and issues created by the flaw in our previous desgin. Continued having issues getting a file read in to act as input.
